`AppealingMindsOfGods_script.R` is the full annotated analysis script to reproduce the results and figures reported in the main paper and supplements.

`AppealingMindsOfGods_supps.pdf` is the supplementary document, which includes notes on data processing, notes on the Hadza data, a codebook, details on salience calculations, additional ethnographic discussions, and supplementary plots and tables.

`FreeList_CERC_V0.1_FIN.csv` is the full free-list data. Note that for eventual future use of the free-list data, we strongly recommend using the dataset stored on the main project repository (https://github.com/bgpurzycki/Evolution-of-Religion-and-Morality), which differs from this dataset only in that the duplicated Hadza data are turned to NAs (see supplementary Section S3 and S7 for details).

`CERC Dataset (Wave 1) Version 6.0.csv` contains demographic information, experimental game data, etc. For details, see main project repository: https://github.com/bgpurzycki/Evolution-of-Religion-and-Morality.
