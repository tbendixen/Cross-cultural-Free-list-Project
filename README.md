Repository for: "Appealing to the minds of gods: A novel cultural evolutionary account of religious appeals and an empirical assessment using ethnographic data from eight diverse societies"

`AppealingMindsOfGods_script.R` is the full analysis script to reproduce the results reported in the paper and supplements.

`FreeList_CERC_V0.1_FIN.csv` is the full free-list data. See Supplements for a codebook. \textbf{Note that For future use of the present dataset, we strongly recommend using the free-list data stored on the main project repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/bgpurzycki/Evolution-of-Religion-and-Morality}}, which differs from this dataset only in that the duplicated Hadza data are turned to NAs.}
